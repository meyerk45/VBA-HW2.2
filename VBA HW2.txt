VBA HW2--REad Me

'Add a column for the Ticker Symbol
    used Credit Card example looping code: 
        If Cells(i + 1, column).Value <>Cells(i, column).Value Then

'Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price 
at the end of the year
    Used example from the Census Bonus. Looped through the data to find the yearly change, percent change and total stock volume with this code:
        YearlyChange = ClosingPrice - OpeningPrice

'the percentabe change from the opening price at the beginning of a give year
to the closing price at the end of that year
    Used google to find the percent change formula. https://www.statology.org/vba-percentage-format/
    PercentChange = (YearlyChange / OpeningPrice) * 100

'The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the included image
    Used Total equation from the Census exercise Pt1
    TotalStockVolume = TotalStockVolume + ws.Cells(1 + 7).Value

Add functionality to script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and 
"Greatest total volume". The solution should match the included image.
    Used the BudgetChecker exercise for the If/ElseIf loop to find the greatest % increase, decrease and greatest total volume:
        If percentchange > MaxpercenIncrease then
            Maxpercentincrease = percentchange
            tickermaxincrease = Ticker
    
    Used the Lotto Winner assignment to find how to retrieve certain values and show/print in another area:
        ws.Cells(2, 16).Value = "Greatest % Increase"

Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green
and negative change in red
    Conditional formating formulas found in the grading group exercise.
        If YearlyChange >= 0 Then
            ws.Cells(SummaryRow, 10).Interior.ColorIndex = 4
        Else...

In addition to the above inclass exercises, I was in office hours and watched another student receive help from the instructor via zoom and saw how his code was laid out, the student's name is Jorge. I used his lay out to help shape my format, in terms of how to group the work. For example how Jorge started his assignment with declaring the integers alltogether at the beginning, helped me because I was declaring my integers as I was needing them and it was really very messy.  So the layout of my solution is based on how Jorge shared his homework during office hours from last Thursday 10/12/2023.
